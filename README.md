# Sensirion SPS-30 Particulate Matter Sensor Driver

[Under active development]

This repository provides multiple implementations of an SPS-30 Particulate Matter sensor. It is intended as both a useful production driver AND an educational code base that demonstrates useful techniques for [designing for change](https://embeddedartistry.com/course/designing-embedded-systems-for-change/) and developing embedded software without actually using the hardware.

# About the Project

This repository provides multiple implementations of an SPS-30 Particulate Matter sensor:

- A slightly refactored vendor driver
- A C++ wrapper for the vendor driver
- A customer driver implementation

The repository also provides example applications that reads from the various sensor implementations.

Tests for the drivers are handled using recorded sensor data. This data is also used to provide a "simulator" mode for development without hardware. Other strategies are also used for simulation, such as using a basic implementation that provides a fixed value.

# Project Status

This project is under active development, and not all implementations or example applications are provided yet.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This project uses [Embedded Artistry's standard Meson build system](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/), and dependencies are described in detail [on our website](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/).

At a minimum you will need:

* [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com), which is used to store "binary" files in this repository
* [Meson](#meson-build-system) is the build system
* Some kind of compiler for your target system.
    - This repository has been tested with:
        - gcc-10, gcc-11, gcc-12
        - arm-none-eabi-gcc
        - Apple clang
        - Mainline clang

#### git-lfs

This project stores some files using [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com).

To install `git-lfs` on Linux:

```
sudo apt install git-lfs
```

To install `git-lfs` on OS X:

```
brew install git-lfs
```

Additional installation instructions can be found on the [`git-lfs` website](https://git-lfs.github.com).

#### Meson Build System

The [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) build system depends on `python3` and `ninja-build`.

To install on Linux:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip ninja-build
```

To install on OSX:

```
brew install python3 ninja
```

Meson can be installed through `pip3`:

```
pip3 install meson
```

If you want to install Meson globally on Linux, use:

```
sudo -H pip3 install meson
```

### Getting the Source

This project uses [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com), so please install it before cloning. If you cloned prior to installing `git-lfs`, simply run `git lfs pull` after installation.

This project is hosted on GitHub. You can clone the project directly using this command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/embvm-drivers/sensirion-sps-30.git
```

If you don't clone recursively, be sure to run the following command in the repository or your build will fail:

```
git submodule update --init
```

### Building

If Make is installed, the library can be built by issuing the following command:

```
make
```

This will build all targets for your current architecture.

You can clean builds using:

```
make clean
```

You can eliminate the generated `buildresults` folder using:

```
make distclean
```

You can also use  `meson` directly for compiling.

Create a build output folder:

```
meson buildresults
```

And build all targets by running

```
ninja -C buildresults
```

Cross-compilation is handled using `meson` cross files. Example files are included in the [`build/cross`](build/cross/) folder. You can write your own cross files for your specific processor by defining the toolchain, compilation flags, and linker flags. These settings will be used to compile the project.

Cross-compilation must be configured using the meson command when creating the build output folder. For example:

```
meson buildresults --cross-file build/cross/gcc_arm_cortex-m4.txt
```

Following that, you can run `make` (at the project root) or `ninja` to build the project.

Tests will not be cross-compiled. They will only be built for the native platform.

**Full instructions for building the project, using alternate toolchains, and running supporting tooling are documented in [Embedded Artistry's Standardized Meson Build System](https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldatlas/embedded-artistrys-standardized-meson-build-system/) on our website.**

### Enabling Link-time Optimization

Link-time Optimization (LTO) can be enabled during the meson configuration stage by setting the built-in option `b_lto` to `true`:

```
meson buildresults -Db_lto=true
```

This can be combined with other build options.

**[Back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Testing

The tests for this library are written with CMocka, which is included as a subproject and does not need to be installed on your system. You can run the tests by issuing the following command:

```
make test
```

By default, test results are generated for use by the CI server and are formatted in JUnit XML. The test results XML files can be found in `buildresults/test/`.

## Configuration Options

The following meson project options can be set for this library when creating the build results directory with `meson`, or by using `meson configure`:

* `disable-builtins` will tell the compiler not to generate built-in function
* `disable-stack-protection` will tell the compiler not to insert stack protection calls
* `disable-rtti` will disable RTTI for C++ projects
* `disable-exceptions` will disable exceptions for C++ projects
* `enable-threading` can be used to control threaded targets and libc++ threading support
* `enable-pedantic`: Turn on `pedantic` warnings
* `enable-pedantic-error`: Turn on `pedantic` warnings and errors
* `hide-unimplemented-libc-apis`: Hides the header definitions for functions which are not actually implemented
* `enable-gnu-extensions` will enable GNU libc extensions that are implemented in this library

The following options can be used to configure `libc++` if used with this project:

* `libcxx-use-compiler-rt`
* `libcxx-use-llvm-libunwind`
* `libcxx-thread-library`
* `libcxx-has-external-thread-api`
* `libcxx-build-external-thread-api`
* `libcxx-enable-chrono`
* `libcxx-enable-filesystem`
* `libcxx-enable-stdinout`
* `libcxx-default-newdelete`
* `libcxx-silent-terminate`
* `libcxx-monotonic-clock`

Options can be specified using `-D` and the option name:

```
meson buildresults -Ddisable-builtins=false
```

The same style works with `meson configure`:

```
cd buildresults
meson configure -Ddisable-builtins=false
```

```
make docs
```

Documentation can be found in `buildresults/docs`, and the root page is `index.html`.
